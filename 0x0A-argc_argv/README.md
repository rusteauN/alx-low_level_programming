## 0x0A. C - argc, argv
# What is C - argc, argv

In a C program, `argc` (short for argument count) and `argv` (short for argument vector) are two parameters passed to the main function. The `argc` parameter is an integer that specifies the number of arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself. The `argv` parameter is an array of character pointers, with each pointer pointing to a null-terminated string that contains an argument.

Here is an example of how `argc` and `argv` might be used in a C program:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc > 1) {
        printf("The first argument is %s\n", argv[1]);
    }
    return 0;
}
This program will print the first argument passed to it when it is run. For example, if the program is called myprogram, and it is run like this:

bash
Copy code
./myprogram hello world
Then the output of the program will be:

csharp
Copy code
The first argument is hello
The argc parameter will have a value of 3, because there are three arguments (myprogram, hello, and world). The argv parameter will be an array of three character pointers, with argv[0] pointing to "myprogram", argv[1] pointing to "hello", and argv[2] pointing to "world".

In the following command, what is argv[2]?
shell
Copy code
$ ./argv "My School is fun"
In the command ./argv "My School is fun", argv[0] would be "./argv" and argv[1] would be "My School is fun". There is no argv[2] in this case, because there are only two arguments.

Note that the argv array will always have at least one element, because the name of the program itself is always considered to be an argument. So in this case, argc would be 2.

In the following command, what is argv[2]?
shell
Copy code
$ ./argv "My School" "is fun"
In the command ./argv "My School" "is fun", argv[0] would be "./argv", argv[1] would be "My School", and argv[2] would be "is fun". There are three arguments in this case, so argc would be 3. The argv array would have three elements, with each element pointing to a null-terminated string containing one of the arguments.

In the following command, what is argv[2]?
shell
Copy code
$ ./argv My School is fun
In the command ./argv My School is fun, argv[0] would be "./argv", argv[1] would be "My", argv[2] would be "School", argv[3] would be “is”, and argv[4] would be “fun”. There are four arguments in this case, separated by spaces. The argc parameter would be 4, and the argv array would have four elements, with each element pointing to a null-terminated string containing one of the arguments.

Note that when arguments are not enclosed in quotes, they are treated as separate arguments based on the spaces between them. In this case, the argument "My School is fun" is treated as three separate arguments: "My", "School", and "is", "fun".

What is argv[argc]?
The argv array in a C program is an array of character pointers, with each pointer pointing to a null-terminated string that contains an argument. The size of the array is determined by the argc parameter, which specifies the number of arguments passed to the program.
The argv[argc] element does not exist, because the argv array is zero-indexed, which means that its elements are numbered from 0 to argc-1. Therefore, the last element of the argv array is argv[argc-1].
For example, if argc is 5, then the argv array will have five elements: argv[0], argv[1], argv[2], argv[3], and argv[4]. The argv[argc] element does not exist in this case.
It is important to note that accessing an element of an array out of bounds can result in undefined behavior. It is generally a good idea to make sure that the array indices used in your program are within the bounds of the array.

What is argv[0]?
In a C program, argv[0] is the first element of the argv array. The argv array is a parameter passed to the main function, and it is an array of character pointers, with each pointer pointing to a null-terminated string that contains an argument.
argv[0] always contains the name of the program itself. For example, if the program is called myprogram, and it is run like this:

shell
Copy code
./myprogram arg1 arg2
Then argv[0] will contain the string "myprogram".
Here is an example of how argv[0] might be used in a C program:

c
Copy code
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("The name of the program is %s\n", argv[0]);
    return 0;
}
This program will print the name of the program when it is run. For example, if the program is called myprogram, and it is run like this:

shell
Copy code
./myprogram
Then the output of the program will be:

csharp
Copy code
The name of the program is myprogram
What is argv?
argv is an array containing the program command line arguments. It is an array of character pointers, with each pointer pointing to a null-terminated string that contains an argument.
argv is a parameter passed to the main function in a C program. The size of the argv array is determined by the argc parameter, which specifies the number of arguments passed to the program.
The argv array contains the command line arguments passed to the program. These arguments are typically separated by spaces on the command line. For example, if the program is called myprogram, and it is run like this:

shell
Copy code
./myprogram arg1 arg2
Then argv will be an array of three elements: argv[0] will be "myprogram", argv[1] will be "arg1", and argv[2] will be "arg2".

Option a. An array containing the program compilation flags is incorrect, because the argv array contains the command line arguments passed to the program at runtime
