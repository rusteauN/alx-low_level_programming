## Description :page_with_curl:
This project focuses on memory allocation in C, specifically on the usage of `malloc` and `free`. It covers concepts related to automatic and dynamic allocation and includes learning objectives such as understanding the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, knowing how to use `malloc` and `free`, and using Valgrind to check for memory leaks.

### Project Details :alarm_clock:
- Author: Julien Barbier
- Weight: 1
- Project Start: Oct 2, 2023, 7:00 AM :calendar:
- Project End: Oct 4, 2023, 7:00 AM :calendar:
- Checker Release: Oct 2, 2023, 7:00 AM :mag:
- Auto review will be launched at the deadline :rocket:

## Concepts :bulb:
For this project, it's essential to understand the following concept:
- Automatic and dynamic allocation, `malloc`, and `free` :gear:

## Resources :books:
Read or watch the following resources:
- [0x0a - malloc & free - quick overview.pdf](link-to-resource)
- [Dynamic memory allocation in C - malloc calloc realloc free (stop at 6:50)](link-to-resource)

Refer to the man pages for additional information:
- `malloc` :book:
- `free` :book:

## Learning Objectives :brain:
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without using external resources:
- General:
  - The difference between automatic and dynamic allocation :chart_with_upwards_trend:
  - What `malloc` and `free` are and how to use them :hammer_and_wrench:
  - When and why to use `malloc` :thinking:
  - How to use Valgrind to check for memory leaks :mag_right:

## Copyright - Plagiarism :no_entry_sign:
- You must develop solutions for the project tasks independently. :raised_hand:
- Copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly prohibited. :no_entry:
- Publishing any content related to this project is not allowed. :no_entry_sign:
- Plagiarism will result in removal from the program. :no_entry_sign:

## Requirements :clipboard:
### General:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs :pencil2:
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` :computer:
- All your files should end with a new line :end:
- You must include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder :file_folder:
- Your code should adhere to the Betty style, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` :shirt:
- Do not use global variables :no_entry_sign:
- Limit the number of functions to no more than 5 functions per file :1234:
- You are allowed to use only the C standard library functions `malloc` and `free`. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., are forbidden :no_entry:
- You can use `_putchar`, but do not push `_putchar.c`, as we will use our own :heavy_check_mark:
- The prototypes of all your functions, including `_putchar`, should be included in a header file named `main.h`, and this header file should be pushed to your repository :file_folder:

*Note: The provided `main.c` files in the examples are for testing purposes and do not need to be included in your repository.* :exclamation:
